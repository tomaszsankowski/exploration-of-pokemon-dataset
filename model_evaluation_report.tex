\section{Executive Summary}

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning models for predicting Pokemon battle outcomes. Through extensive experimentation with Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, we achieved a maximum accuracy of \textbf{95.13\%} using Random Forest with optimized hyperparameters. The study demonstrates that ensemble methods significantly outperform individual classifiers for this complex prediction task.

\section{Introduction}

The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the winner in Pokemon battles based on statistical features. Pokemon battles involve complex interactions between various attributes including base stats, types, and derived features. This analysis explores multiple algorithms and feature engineering approaches to achieve optimal prediction performance.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Dataset Overview}
The dataset consists of Pokemon battle records with features including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Base statistics (Attack, Defense, HP, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
    \item Type information and effectiveness
    \item Derived features (stat differences, speed ratios)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Feature Engineering Experiments}
Three feature engineering approaches were evaluated:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stat Differences Only}: Using only statistical differences between Pokemon
    \item \textbf{Standardized Features}: Normalized feature scaling
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Features}: Extended feature set with derived attributes
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Selection}
Four machine learning algorithms were implemented and evaluated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Random Forest (RF)
    \item Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    \item Logistic Regression (LR)
    \item Decision Tree (DT)
\end{itemize}
