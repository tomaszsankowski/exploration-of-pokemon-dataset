## üìå General Description of the Dataset

The "Weedle's Cave" dataset contains information about battles between Pok√©mon characters and their attributes. The data originates from Kaggle and is designed for educational purposes. The task is to build a predictive model that can forecast the outcome of battles between two Pok√©mon based on their features.

## üéØ Exploration Goal and Success Criteria

The goal of the project is binary classification ‚Äì to predict whether the first Pok√©mon will win the battle.  
**Success criteria:**
- Achieve an accuracy of at least 90% on the validation set,
- Identify the most important features influencing battle outcomes.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Results

### Value Distributions:
- Histograms for all numeric features (`HP`, `Attack`, `Defense`, etc.).
- Histograms for categorical features such as Pok√©mon types and Legendary status.
- Distribution of wins: how often the first Pok√©mon wins versus the second.

### Correlations:
- Correlation analysis between numerical attributes (e.g., `Attack` vs `Defense`).
- Correlation heatmap of numeric features.

### Preliminary Findings:
- Pok√©mon types are unevenly distributed.
- Legendary Pok√©mon are rare but have significantly higher stats.

## ‚ùó Data Quality Notes

- **Missing Data:** Only missing values in `Type 2` (no secondary type).
- **Outliers:** Legendary Pok√©mon are outliers with very high stats.
- **Inconsistencies:** None found.
- **Unclear Data:** None.
