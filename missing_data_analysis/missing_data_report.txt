COMBATS DATASET ANALYSIS:
=========================

Dataset Overview:
- Total rows: 50,000
- Total columns: 3
- Total cells: 150,000

Missing Data Summary:
- Missing cells: 0
- Missing percentage: 0.0000%
- Complete rows: 50,000
- Data quality: Excellent - No missing data

RECOMMENDATIONS:
===============

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Type 2 missing values should be treated as "None" or "Single-type"
   - Consider creating a binary indicator for dual-type Pokemon
   - No issues found in combats dataset

2. Analysis Implications:
   - Missing Type 2 data is systematic (single-type Pokemon)
   - This is not random missing data but represents a real category
   - Include missing Type 2 as a valid category in analysis

3. Data Quality Assessment:
   - Pokemon dataset: High quality with expected missing pattern
   - Combats dataset: Complete dataset with no missing values
   - Overall data integrity: Excellent

TECHNICAL NOTES:
===============

Missing Data Mechanism:
- Type 2 missingness is "Missing Completely At Random" (MCAR) for single-type Pokemon
- This represents a legitimate data structure, not a data quality issue
- No imputation recommended - treat as categorical "None" value

Data Validation:
- All Pokemon IDs in combats dataset exist in Pokemon dataset
- No duplicate records found
- Data types are appropriate for analysis
